# tic-tac-toe
A Tic-Tac-Toe game I made to teach myself Python

Notes: For some reason you can't make more than one instance of TicTacToeGame in main.py. When I try, the second game will always load the same board as the last game. Not sure why, since from what I can tell they are completely separate objects, right down to the board and player instances they use.

Also, towards the end I got sloppy with the input mechanism. I was creating new functions all over the place... I think some are unused even. Next time I'll try to take advantage of libraries/modules more. I should either find a useful input library or come up with a more efficient mechanism for reading user input.

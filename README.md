# tic-tac-toe
A Tic-Tac-Toe game I made to teach myself Python

Notes: For some reason you can't make more than one instance of TicTacToeGame in main.py. When I try, the second game will always load the same board as the last game. Not sure why, since from what I can tell they are completely separate objects, right down to the board and player instances they use.
